### subtitle: "Replication data from experiment: 

### *Social Competition Drives Collective Action to Reduce Informal Waste Burning in Uganda*"

Exploring how specification changes results. Data source; Buntaine et al. (2024)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Open source data & applied study:

Open access data was utilized for this class exercise from the study (Buntaine et al., 2024):

> Buntaine, M. T., Komakech, P., & Shen, S. V. (2024). *Social competition drives collective action to reduce informal waste burning in Uganda*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 121(23). https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2319712121

### Outline - What are the goals of this exercise?

#### 1.  Start with a simple OLS model

#### 2.  Demonstrate the rationale for estimating progressively complex models

#### 3.  Illustrate a causal inference approach (i.e., identify `robust` estimators)

#### 4. Conclusion: What is the take-home message of the Lab-1 exercise? . . .

    Estimating complex models is a relatively easy part of our work as data scientists...

    * Making informed specification decisions & communicating results is the hard part
    (i.e., the science side of `data science`)!
